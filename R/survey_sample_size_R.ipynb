    "Your primary concern when conducting a survey should not be with the meaning, but with the __reliability of results__. An important factor for drawing general conclusions from a survey is its sample size. As opposed to running a power analysis for A/B tests, decisions on minimum required __sample sizes for surveys are based on confidence intervals__, thus the level of uncertainty one is willing to accept when reporting population estimates sunch means or proportions.\n",

    "Depending on a survey's target KPI there are different ways to estimate a minimum required sample size. However, they do share similar input parameters:\n",
    "- __Margin of error:__\n",
    "    - The margin of error marks the amount of deviation around the true value (that we try to estimate with our survey) we are willing to accept. It's typically set to $ ME â‰¤ 0.05$ (smaller or equal to 5%) and is half the width of the confidence interval.\n",
    "- __Alpha:__\n",
    "    - $Type I$ error or probability of finding an effect when there is none (false positive). It's used to define the confidence level which represents the degree of certainty we aim to have in the range of possible true values given by our population estimate and it's margin of error. Typically, you'd choose a 5% $Type I$ error rate for 95% confidence (100-5), thus set $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n",
    "- __Size of population:__\n",
    "    - Oftentimes we don't know exactly how large the underlying population of our survey is, but if we have an idea of its size (and it's not infite) we can use this information to correct our sample size estimate:\n",
