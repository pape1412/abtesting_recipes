    "Defining a desired boundary of practical significance in advance is very useful during the planning of an A/B test. Once you know the required minimum effect you expect and/or you need to achieve you can determine __how many observations__ are neccessary in order to achieve a desired level of measurement reliability. In situations where external constraints put a limit on our sample sizes you're able to work your way backwards and estimate a __minimum detectable effect__ for reaching a significant experiment result. Finally, this knowledge can be translated into __how long__ your test ultimately needs to run and whether or not it's feasible."

    "Since alpha and power are usually set to .05 and .80 your primary concern needs to be with the effect size. The most commonly asked question at this point is 'How can I know the expected effect when I haven’t run the test yet?'. Again, you should approach this question by thinking about your desired level of pracitical significance which is basically the threshold - once passed - that justifies the additional effort of rolling out the variation to all of your users. However, if you're unsure you can still refer back to more general effect size levels as shown for Cohen's d and Cohen's h below.\n",

This convention implies a four-to-one trade off between β-risk and α-risk. (β is the probability of a Type II error, and α is the probability of a Type I error; .2 and .05 are conventional values for β and α). However, there will be times when this 4-to-1 weighting is inappropriate.\n",
